# task-1-team-2
We were given two tasks.
1)Task 1: Number Guessing
Let's assume Vipul is guessing a 2 digit number and the computer has already decided a number randomly between 01 to 99. If Vipul's guess is higher than the computer's decided number, print guess is high and if lower then print guess is low and if the guess is correct print guess is correct, and also print number of guesses required by Vipul to guess the number.
2)Task 2: Rock | Paper | Scissor
Vipul is trying to play rock paper scissors with the computer. Write a code to play the game in which when Vipul enters his input it has to be evaluated to computers random value ( rock or paper or scissor), print who won computer or Vipul, ask them if Vipul won't to play again, if yes continue the game else display both Vipul's and computer's score.
solutions for the task are in this repository which are solved using Python.
